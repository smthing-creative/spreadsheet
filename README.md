# spreadsheet
Functional Programming is a popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, developers organize code into smaller functions, then combine those functions to build complex programs.

In this spreadsheet application project, I learned about parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing spreadsheet functions, handling cell references, and creating interactive web interfaces. I also learned how to dynamically update the page based on user input.

This project covers concepts like the map() method, find() method, parseInt(), the includes() method.
